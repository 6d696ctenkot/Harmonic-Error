# Harmonic-Error

This is an app that displays a pulsating gradient, shifting colors in a seemingly chaotic way, synchronized with strange glitchy sounds (or their imitation). At some point, the screen begins to "break down," glitching — as if the app is malfunctioning or something is trying to escape from it.

Characteristics:
Aesthetic: cyberpunk glitch art
Interaction: no traditional UI, the entire app feels like it's alive and acting on its own
Shock factor: at a certain moment, the screen suddenly blurs, flickers, or changes — as if the phone is freezing or being overtaken
